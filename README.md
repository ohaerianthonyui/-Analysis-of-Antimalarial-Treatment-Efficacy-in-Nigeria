4. **Targeted Public Health Campaigns:**
   Public health initiatives should target **adults**, the demographic most affected by malaria, with emphasis on preventative measures and early treatment. Since **children** appear less affected in this dataset, there may be opportunities to focus efforts on those most at risk in the adult population.

5. **Gender-Specific Treatment Protocols:**
   Although the difference in treatment outcomes between male and female patients is small, further investigation into potential gender-based differences in drug response could be valuable. Gender-specific treatment regimens might be considered in future malaria management strategies.

6. **Continuous Monitoring of Drug Efficacy:**
   Regular surveillance of drug efficacy across different regions, particularly in the North East, should be a priority to ensure that treatment protocols remain effective. Tracking regional resistance patterns can inform timely adjustments to malaria treatment guidelines.

7. **Public Awareness of Malaria Symptoms:**
   Educating the public about the common symptoms of malaria, particularly **Fatigue**, **Muscle Pain**, **Sweating**, **Nausea**, and **Chills**, is essential for early identification and treatment. Public health campaigns should emphasize the importance of seeking treatment early to avoid complications associated with untreated malaria.

By implementing these recommendations, Nigeria can improve the effectiveness of its malaria control programs and reduce the burden of the disease on its population.
